# Number_Prediction

Deep Learning is becoming a very popular subset of machine learning due to its high level of performance across many types of data.<br>
A great way to use deep learning to classify images is to build a convolutional neural network (CNN).<br>
The Keras library in Python makes it pretty simple to build a CNN.<br>
In this repository: <br>
our target to predict number images we use The mnist dataset is conveniently provided to us as part of the Keras library.<br>
then we load the model in keras format <br>
 we use an image to predict and get the result .<br>
